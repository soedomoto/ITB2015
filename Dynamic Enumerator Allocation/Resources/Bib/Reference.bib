Some of the key challenges in the development of this type of systems are the following: acquisition, management and use of data context. In this paper, we propose two-level software architecture to obtain, use and provide context information in a MDS. From our point of view, the proposed architecture takes into account the requirements that emerge from data collection, use and management of context, as well as the own features of MDS. Based on our software architecture, a context-aware group communication system is implemented, which allows members to have four types of context: physical activity, logical activity, location and level of sound.},

	abstract = {In recent years, well-designed terminal-based methods for collecting index data have gradually replaced traditional pen-and-paper methods and have been extensively used in numerous studies. These new approaches offer users increased accuracy, efficiency, consumption, and data compatibility compared to traditional methods. In general, we find that spatial data content and quality index systems vary widely across different arable land regions. Thus, a system for the investigation of arable land quality indices that has the flexibility to utilize various types of spatial data and quality indices without requiring program modification is needed. This paper presents the framework, the module partition, and the structure of the data exchange interface for a highly flexible mobile GIS-based system, which we call the “arable land quality index data collection system” (ALQIDCS). This system incorporates a series of self-adaptive methods, a data table-driven model and two types of formulas for flexible data collection and processing. We tested our prototype system by investigating arable land quality in the Da Xing District, Beijing and in the Te Da La Qi District, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that the ALQIDCS can effectively adapt to variations in spatial data and quality index systems and meet different objectives. The limitations of the ALQIDCS and suggestions for future work are also presented.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the ubiquity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) has encouraged the development of context-aware and personalized computation to filter the query results and provide recommendations based on different situations of a user. On the other hand, global positioning system (GPS) technology along with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors enables location sensing on mobile devices. Context-aware computation can provide customized services in different contexts - where context is related to the user's location, activity and historical information. Our main focus in this paper, the Context-aware Recommendation System (Co-ARS), is one of the major applications that has been refined over the years due to the evolving geospatial technologies and data mining. The proposed Co-ARS application achieves the list of recommendations by utilizing the user's context information (such as location and preferred transportation mode), item's context information (such as restaurant ratings and types), and personalized preference information (based on individuals past behavior). In this paper, we have described the application of such a system in the City of Calgary using android smartphones. The implemented system used various data filtering and management techniques to provide beneficial and accurate recommendation results to the users.},

In general, behavior patterns are important information about how elders live, and caregivers can thus take care of elders easily with the help from that informaiton. So far, there are many research results related to learning of human behavior; however, their assumptions are usually either too simple or inflexible to account for complex human behaviors in real life, which change dynamically depending on contexts. We here present a context-aware framework for human behavior learning and prediction. Such framework discovers contexts from resident's real life data and adapts correspoinding behavior patterns next accordingly. We evaluate the framework on two public datasets, and the experimental results show promising results.},

	doi = {10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737358},
	abstract = {The choice of music in everyday life is greatly influenced by contextual circumstances surrounding music listeners. Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.},

In this paper, we apply Aspect-Driven Design Approach to separate the concerns in UI, and have them automatically tangled together at runtime. Such separation introduces the single point to maintain, and the runtime weaving enables us to deliver context-aware UI. Furthermore, we apply this concept into distributed environment. This allows us to construct UI in various platforms on multiple client devices from the single concerns description streamed from the server.},

Mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors and become computationally powerful, which allows for real-time fusion and processing of data gathered by them. However, most of existing frameworks for context-aware systems, are usually dedicated to static, centralized architectures, and those that were designed for mobile devices, focus mainly on limited resources in terms of CPU and memory, which in nowadays world is no longer a big issue. Mobile platforms require from the context modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight, but on the other hand - to be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identification tasks but also more complex reasoning. These, with combination of a large number of sensors and CPU power available on mobile devices result in high energy consumption of a system. The original contribution of this paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context-aware frameworks, that is able to learn sensor usage habits, and minimize energy consumption of the system.},

New recommendation algorithm has innovation mainly in the following three aspects: At first, new algorithm changes the traditional processing method of time dimension, it divides 24 hours into some periods of time in accordance with the time law of people's work and life, so the user similarity calculated by such periods of time will be more accurate; Secondly, the DBSCAN algorithm is improved by introducing grid thought, which makes the clustering object is no longer a single check-in point, but a grid contained a lot of check-in points, this improves the speed of recommendation algorithm greatly; Finally, a new rating function of the potential points of interest which are never visited by the user is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the speed and precision of recommendation system obviously.},

	abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to infer users' interests and to generate personalized location recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific, we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

	abstract = {Publish/Subscribe is the paradigm in which users express long-term interests (“subscriptions”) and some agent “publishes” events (e.g., offers). The job of Publish/Subscribe software is to send events to the owners of subscriptions satisfied by those events. For example, a user subscription may consist of an interest in an airplane of a certain type, not to exceed a certain price. A published event may consist of an offer of an airplane with certain properties including price. Each subscription consists of a conjunction of (attribute, comparison operator, value) predicates. A subscription closely resembles a trigger in that it is a long-lived conditional query associated with an action (usually, informing the subscriber). However, it is less general than a trigger so novel data structures and implementations may enable the creation of more scalable, high performance publish/subscribe systems. This paper describes an attempt at the construction of such algorithms and its implementation. Using a combination of data structures, application-specific caching policies, and application-specific query processing our system can handle 600 events per second for a typical workload containing 6 million subscriptions.},

The successful development of push-based LBS applications relies on the existence of a publish/subscribe middleware that can handle spatial relationship. This paper presents an efficient spatial publish/subscribe system that can serve as the middleware for intelligent LBS applications. The basic models, including spatial event model, spatial subscription model and notification model, are introduced and the over-all architecture is presented. Two kinds of spatial predicate that can meet most common requirement of intelligent location aware applications are also discussed. Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial event processing approach that dispatches the spatial subscriptions to self-positioning mobile devices. By leveraging client-side computing resource and decreasing the communication times, the server-side workload is relieved and the communication cost is reduced. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

	abstract = {The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, seeking to service a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles. It is an important problem in field of distribution, transportation and logistics. But the traditional VRP doesn't consider the traffic condition of the road network. In this paper we provide a mapreduce based hybrid genetic solution using island approach for solving large scale vehicle routing problems in dynamic network with fluctuant link travel time. We used a hybrid approach for generating a mélange of both random and locally optimized population using routing construction algorithms (NNC, Savings and Random). Island model is used for parallelization of genetic algorithm as it has been informally argued that having multiple subpopulations helps to preserve genetic diversity, since each island can potentially follow a different search trajectory through the search space. Various local search methods such as 2-opt have been applied for improving the routes. Our algorithm design and implementation of TDVRPTW is deployed on Hadoop, an open source implementation of MapReduce. Computation results of test problems on a distributed platform showed a tremendous improvement, both in terms of computation time and efficiency.},

	abstract = {The min–max Split Delivery Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Minimum Service Time Requirement (min–max SDMDVRP-MSTR) is a variant of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem. Each customer requires a specified amount of service time. The service time can be split among vehicles as long as each vehicle spends a minimum amount of service time at a customer. The objective is to minimize the duration of the longest route (where duration is the sum of travel and service times).

We develop a heuristic (denoted by MDS) that solves the min–max SDMDVRP-MSTR in three stages: (1) initialize a feasible solution without splits; (2) improve the longest routes by splitting service times; (3) ensure all minimum service time requirements are satisfied. The first stage of MDS is compared to an existing heuristic to solve the min–max Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem on 43 benchmark instances. MDS produces 37 best-known solutions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MDS on 21 new instances whose (near) optimal solutions can be estimated based on geometry. Finally, we investigate the savings from split service and the split patterns as we vary the required service times, the average number of customers per route, and the minimum service time requirement.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel three-phase heuristic/algorithmic approach for the multi-depot routing problem with time windows and heterogeneous vehicles. It has been derived from embedding a heuristic-based clustering algorithm within a VRPTW optimization framework. To this purpose, a rigorous MILP mathematical model for the VRPTW problem is first introduced. Likewise other optimization approaches, the new formulation can efficiently solve case studies involving at most 25 nodes to optimality. To overcome this limitation, a preprocessing stage clustering nodes together is initially performed to yield a more compact cluster-based MILP problem formulation. In this way, a hierarchical hybrid procedure involving one heuristic and two algorithmic phases was developed. Phase I aims to identifying a set of cost-effective feasible clusters while Phase II assigns clusters to vehicles and sequences them on each tour by using the cluster-based MILP formulation. Ordering nodes within clusters and scheduling vehicle arrival times at customer locations for each tour through solving a small MILP model is finally performed at Phase III. Numerous benchmark problems featuring different sizes, clustered/random customer locations and time window distributions have been solved at acceptable CPU times.},
