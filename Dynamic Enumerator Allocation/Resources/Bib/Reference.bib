Some of the key challenges in the development of this type of systems are the following: acquisition, management and use of data context. In this paper, we propose two-level software architecture to obtain, use and provide context information in a MDS. From our point of view, the proposed architecture takes into account the requirements that emerge from data collection, use and management of context, as well as the own features of MDS. Based on our software architecture, a context-aware group communication system is implemented, which allows members to have four types of context: physical activity, logical activity, location and level of sound.},

	abstract = {In recent years, well-designed terminal-based methods for collecting index data have gradually replaced traditional pen-and-paper methods and have been extensively used in numerous studies. These new approaches offer users increased accuracy, efficiency, consumption, and data compatibility compared to traditional methods. In general, we find that spatial data content and quality index systems vary widely across different arable land regions. Thus, a system for the investigation of arable land quality indices that has the flexibility to utilize various types of spatial data and quality indices without requiring program modification is needed. This paper presents the framework, the module partition, and the structure of the data exchange interface for a highly flexible mobile GIS-based system, which we call the “arable land quality index data collection system” (ALQIDCS). This system incorporates a series of self-adaptive methods, a data table-driven model and two types of formulas for flexible data collection and processing. We tested our prototype system by investigating arable land quality in the Da Xing District, Beijing and in the Te Da La Qi District, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that the ALQIDCS can effectively adapt to variations in spatial data and quality index systems and meet different objectives. The limitations of the ALQIDCS and suggestions for future work are also presented.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the ubiquity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) has encouraged the development of context-aware and personalized computation to filter the query results and provide recommendations based on different situations of a user. On the other hand, global positioning system (GPS) technology along with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors enables location sensing on mobile devices. Context-aware computation can provide customized services in different contexts - where context is related to the user's location, activity and historical information. Our main focus in this paper, the Context-aware Recommendation System (Co-ARS), is one of the major applications that has been refined over the years due to the evolving geospatial technologies and data mining. The proposed Co-ARS application achieves the list of recommendations by utilizing the user's context information (such as location and preferred transportation mode), item's context information (such as restaurant ratings and types), and personalized preference information (based on individuals past behavior). In this paper, we have described the application of such a system in the City of Calgary using android smartphones. The implemented system used various data filtering and management techniques to provide beneficial and accurate recommendation results to the users.},

In general, behavior patterns are important information about how elders live, and caregivers can thus take care of elders easily with the help from that informaiton. So far, there are many research results related to learning of human behavior; however, their assumptions are usually either too simple or inflexible to account for complex human behaviors in real life, which change dynamically depending on contexts. We here present a context-aware framework for human behavior learning and prediction. Such framework discovers contexts from resident's real life data and adapts correspoinding behavior patterns next accordingly. We evaluate the framework on two public datasets, and the experimental results show promising results.},

	doi = {10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737358},
	abstract = {The choice of music in everyday life is greatly influenced by contextual circumstances surrounding music listeners. Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.},

In this paper, we apply Aspect-Driven Design Approach to separate the concerns in UI, and have them automatically tangled together at runtime. Such separation introduces the single point to maintain, and the runtime weaving enables us to deliver context-aware UI. Furthermore, we apply this concept into distributed environment. This allows us to construct UI in various platforms on multiple client devices from the single concerns description streamed from the server.},

Mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors and become computationally powerful, which allows for real-time fusion and processing of data gathered by them. However, most of existing frameworks for context-aware systems, are usually dedicated to static, centralized architectures, and those that were designed for mobile devices, focus mainly on limited resources in terms of CPU and memory, which in nowadays world is no longer a big issue. Mobile platforms require from the context modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight, but on the other hand - to be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identification tasks but also more complex reasoning. These, with combination of a large number of sensors and CPU power available on mobile devices result in high energy consumption of a system. The original contribution of this paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context-aware frameworks, that is able to learn sensor usage habits, and minimize energy consumption of the system.},

New recommendation algorithm has innovation mainly in the following three aspects: At first, new algorithm changes the traditional processing method of time dimension, it divides 24 hours into some periods of time in accordance with the time law of people's work and life, so the user similarity calculated by such periods of time will be more accurate; Secondly, the DBSCAN algorithm is improved by introducing grid thought, which makes the clustering object is no longer a single check-in point, but a grid contained a lot of check-in points, this improves the speed of recommendation algorithm greatly; Finally, a new rating function of the potential points of interest which are never visited by the user is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the speed and precision of recommendation system obviously.},

	abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to infer users' interests and to generate personalized location recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific, we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},
