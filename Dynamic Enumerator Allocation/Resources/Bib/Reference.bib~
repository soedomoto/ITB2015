	abstract = {The Request-Response (RR) paradigm is widely used in ubiquitous systems to exchange information in a secure, reliable and timely manner. Nonetheless, there is also an emerging need for adopting the Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) paradigm in this kind of systems, due to the advantages that this paradigm offers in supporting mobility by means of asynchronous, non-blocking and one-to-many message distribution semantics for event notification. This paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of both the RR and PubSub paradigms to support communications in ubiquitous systems and proposes an abstract communication model in order to enable their seamless integration. Thus, developers will be focused on communication semantics and the required quality properties, rather than be concerned about specific communication mechanisms. The aim is to provide developers with abstractions intended to decrease the complexity of integrating different communication paradigms commonly needed in ubiquitous systems. The proposal has been applied to implement a middleware and a real home automation system to show its applicability and benefits.},

	abstract = {Smart grids heavily depend on communication in order to coordinate the generation, distribution, and consumption of energy-even more so if distributed power plants based on renewable energies are taken into account. Given the variety of communication partners, a heterogeneous network infrastructure consisting of IP-based and suitable field-level networks is the most appropriate solution. This paper investigates such a two-tier infrastructure and possible field-level networks with particular attention to metering and supervisory control and data acquisition applications. For the problem of network integration, a combination of gateway and tunneling solutions is proposed which allows a semitransparent end-to-end connection between application servers and field nodes. The feasibility of the approach and implementation details are discussed at the example of powerline communication and IP-based networks investigated in the European research project on real-time energy management via powerlines and internet. Nevertheless, it is shown that the communication architecture is versatile enough to serve as a generic solution for smart grids.},

	abstract = {The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) provides means to describe functional aspects of a service in a service oriented architecture (SOA) based on Web service technology. In contrast to its predecessor (WSDL 1.1), WSDL 2.0 does not define a fixed set of operation types but provides for a generic mechanism to define an operation by means of message exchange patterns (MEPs). In this paper we compare the expressivity of MEPs in general with other work and formalisms in the field of service interaction. Furthermore, we identify new MEPs and extend the template used to define MEPs to allow expressing more complex patterns. We give a refined definition of MEPs based on a detailed discussion and discuss how WSDL and the MEPs in particular can be combined with the choreography approach.},

	abstract = {Enterprise Integration Patterns provides an invaluable catalog of sixty-five patterns, with real-world solutions that demonstrate the formidable of messaging and help you to design effective messaging solutions for your enterprise.The authors also include examples covering a variety of different integration technologies, such as JMS, MSMQ, TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, Microsoft BizTalk, SOAP, and XSL. A case study describing a bond trading system illustrates the patterns in practice, and the book offers a look at emerging standards, as well as insights into what the future of enterprise integration might hold.This book provides a consistent vocabulary and visual notation framework to describe large-scale integration solutions across many technologies. It also explores in detail the advantages and limitations of asynchronous messaging architectures. The authors present practical advice on designing code that connects an application to a messaging system, and provide extensive information to help you determine when to send a message, how to route it to the proper destination, and how to monitor the health of a messaging system. If you want to know how to manage, monitor, and maintain a messaging system once it is in use, get this book.},

Some of the key challenges in the development of this type of systems are the following: acquisition, management and use of data context. In this paper, we propose two-level software architecture to obtain, use and provide context information in a MDS. From our point of view, the proposed architecture takes into account the requirements that emerge from data collection, use and management of context, as well as the own features of MDS. Based on our software architecture, a context-aware group communication system is implemented, which allows members to have four types of context: physical activity, logical activity, location and level of sound.},

Thus, a system for the investigation of arable land quality indices that has the flexibility to utilize various types of spatial data and quality indices without requiring program modification is needed. This paper presents the framework, the module partition, and the structure of the data exchange interface for a highly flexible mobile GIS-based system, which we call the “arable land quality index data collection system” (ALQIDCS). This system incorporates a series of self-adaptive methods, a data table-driven model and two types of formulas for flexible data collection and processing. We tested our prototype system by investigating arable land quality in the Da Xing District, Beijing and in the Te Da La Qi District, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that the ALQIDCS can effectively adapt to variations in spatial data and quality index systems and meet different objectives. The limitations of the ALQIDCS and suggestions for future work are also presented.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the ubiquity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) has encouraged the development of context-aware and personalized computation to filter the query results and provide recommendations based on different situations of a user. On the other hand, global positioning system (GPS) technology along with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors enables location sensing on mobile devices. Context-aware computation can provide customized services in different contexts - where context is related to the user's location, activity and historical information. Our main focus in this paper, the Context-aware Recommendation System (Co-ARS), is one of the major applications that has been refined over the years due to the evolving geospatial technologies and data mining. The proposed Co-ARS application achieves the list of recommendations by utilizing the user's context information (such as location and preferred transportation mode), item's context information (such as restaurant ratings and types), and personalized preference information (based on individuals past behavior). In this paper, we have described the application of such a system in the City of Calgary using android smartphones. The implemented system used various data filtering and management techniques to provide beneficial and accurate recommendation results to the users.},

In general, behavior patterns are important information about how elders live, and caregivers can thus take care of elders easily with the help from that informaiton. So far, there are many research results related to learning of human behavior; however, their assumptions are usually either too simple or inflexible to account for complex human behaviors in real life, which change dynamically depending on contexts. We here present a context-aware framework for human behavior learning and prediction. Such framework discovers contexts from resident's real life data and adapts correspoinding behavior patterns next accordingly. We evaluate the framework on two public datasets, and the experimental results show promising results.},

	doi = {10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737358},
	abstract = {The choice of music in everyday life is greatly influenced by contextual circumstances surrounding music listeners. Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978. This tends to suggest that context-aware music recommendation systems is probably what music lover expect from music stores.},

In this paper, we apply Aspect-Driven Design Approach to separate the concerns in UI, and have them automatically tangled together at runtime. Such separation introduces the single point to maintain, and the runtime weaving enables us to deliver context-aware UI. Furthermore, we apply this concept into distributed environment. This allows us to construct UI in various platforms on multiple client devices from the single concerns description streamed from the server.},

Mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors and become computationally powerful, which allows for real-time fusion and processing of data gathered by them. However, most of existing frameworks for context-aware systems, are usually dedicated to static, centralized architectures, and those that were designed for mobile devices, focus mainly on limited resources in terms of CPU and memory, which in nowadays world is no longer a big issue. Mobile platforms require from the context modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight, but on the other hand - to be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identification tasks but also more complex reasoning. These, with combination of a large number of sensors and CPU power available on mobile devices result in high energy consumption of a system. The original contribution of this paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context-aware frameworks, that is able to learn sensor usage habits, and minimize energy consumption of the system.},

New recommendation algorithm has innovation mainly in the following three aspects: At first, new algorithm changes the traditional processing method of time dimension, it divides 24 hours into some periods of time in accordance with the time law of people's work and life, so the user similarity calculated by such periods of time will be more accurate; Secondly, the DBSCAN algorithm is improved by introducing grid thought, which makes the clustering object is no longer a single check-in point, but a grid contained a lot of check-in points, this improves the speed of recommendation algorithm greatly; Finally, a new rating function of the potential points of interest which are never visited by the user is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the speed and precision of recommendation system obviously.},

	abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to infer users' interests and to generate personalized location recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific, we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

According to the 1986 Statistical Abstract of the United States, freight transportation outlays for local trucking totaled 80.9 billion dollars in 1983. Thus, location/routing decisions have considerable economic importance in domains such as distribution systems planning. Since location and routing decisions are closely related, integrated models that consider the two aspects simultaneously offer the promise of more effective and economical decisions. However, such integrated models are complex and their design poses challenges in combining the short-term operational considerations of vehicle routing with the medium/long-term strategic issues of facility location. This paper discusses recent research related to various modeling approaches for location/routing problems, including comprehensive mathematical programming formulations, analytical approximations, and modified facility location models. We assess the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches and give possible directions for future research.},

There is a server, who must perform a service tour that includes all customers requiring service. The order of providing service to customers for each potential list of calls is uniquely defined by some a priori fixed basic sequence of all the customers (a priori tour). The problems considered in this paper are to find an optimal home location for the server and (or) an optimal basic sequence so as to minimize the expected total waiting time or the expected maximal waiting time of customers, subject to the constraint that the expected total length of the tour is minimal. For these problems on a tree, polynomial algorithms are presented with complexity O(n log n) for general trees and O(n) for trees with bounded vertex degree. Reoptimization variants of these problems on a tree (when the server can reoptimize his tour for each list of calls) are also investigated.},

	abstract = {Two algorithms for solving the (symmetric distance) traveling salesman problem have been programmed for a high-speed digital computer. The first produces guaranteed optimal solution for problems involving no more than 13 cities; the time required (IBM 7094 II) varies from 60 milliseconds for a 9-city problem to 1.75 seconds for a 13-city problem. The second algorithm produces precisely characterized, locally optimal solutions for large problems (up to 145 cities) in an extremely short time and is based on a general heuristic approach believed to be of general applicability to various optimization problems. The average time required to obtain a locally optimal solution is under 30n3 microseconds where n is the number of cities involved. Repeated runs on a problem from random initial tours result in a high probability of finding the optimal solution among the locally optimal solutions obtained. For large problems where many locally optimal solutions have to be obtained in order to be reasonably assured of having the optimal solution, an efficient reduction scheme is incorporated in the program to reduce the total computation time by a substantial amount.},

	abstract = {Publish/Subscribe is the paradigm in which users express long-term interests (“subscriptions”) and some agent “publishes” events (e.g., offers). The job of Publish/Subscribe software is to send events to the owners of subscriptions satisfied by those events. For example, a user subscription may consist of an interest in an airplane of a certain type, not to exceed a certain price. A published event may consist of an offer of an airplane with certain properties including price. Each subscription consists of a conjunction of (attribute, comparison operator, value) predicates. A subscription closely resembles a trigger in that it is a long-lived conditional query associated with an action (usually, informing the subscriber). However, it is less general than a trigger so novel data structures and implementations may enable the creation of more scalable, high performance publish/subscribe systems. This paper describes an attempt at the construction of such algorithms and its implementation. Using a combination of data structures, application-specific caching policies, and application-specific query processing our system can handle 600 events per second for a typical workload containing 6 million subscriptions.},

	abstract = {The advance in wireless Internet and mobile computing brought the booming of intelligent Location-Based Services(LBS), which can actively push location-dependent information to mobile users according to their predefined interest. The successful development of push-based LBS applications relies on the existence of a publish/subscribe middleware that can handle spatial relationship. This paper presents an efficient spatial publish/subscribe system that can serve as the middleware for intelligent LBS applications. The basic models, including spatial event model, spatial subscription model and notification model, are introduced and the over-all architecture is presented. Two kinds of spatial predicate that can meet most common requirement of intelligent location aware applications are also discussed. Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial event processing approach that dispatches the spatial subscriptions to self-positioning mobile devices. By leveraging client-side computing resource and decreasing the communication times, the server-side workload is relieved and the communication cost is reduced. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

It is an important problem in field of distribution, transportation and logistics. But the traditional VRP doesn't consider the traffic condition of the road network. In this paper we provide a mapreduce based hybrid genetic solution using island approach for solving large scale vehicle routing problems in dynamic network with fluctuant link travel time. We used a hybrid approach for generating a mélange of both random and locally optimized population using routing construction algorithms (NNC, Savings and Random). Island model is used for parallelization of genetic algorithm as it has been informally argued that having multiple subpopulations helps to preserve genetic diversity, since each island can potentially follow a different search trajectory through the search space. Various local search methods such as 2-opt have been applied for improving the routes. Our algorithm design and implementation of TDVRPTW is deployed on Hadoop, an open source implementation of MapReduce. Computation results of test problems on a distributed platform showed a tremendous improvement, both in terms of computation time and efficiency.},

Each customer requires a specified amount of service time. The service time can be split among vehicles as long as each vehicle spends a minimum amount of service time at a customer. The objective is to minimize the duration of the longest route (where duration is the sum of travel and service times).

We develop a heuristic (denoted by MDS) that solves the min–max SDMDVRP-MSTR in three stages: (1) initialize a feasible solution without splits; (2) improve the longest routes by splitting service times; (3) ensure all minimum service time requirements are satisfied. The first stage of MDS is compared to an existing heuristic to solve the min–max Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem on 43 benchmark instances. MDS produces 37 best-known solutions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MDS on 21 new instances whose (near) optimal solutions can be estimated based on geometry. Finally, we investigate the savings from split service and the split patterns as we vary the required service times, the average number of customers per route, and the minimum service time requirement.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel three-phase heuristic/algorithmic approach for the multi-depot routing problem with time windows and heterogeneous vehicles. It has been derived from embedding a heuristic-based clustering algorithm within a VRPTW optimization framework. To this purpose, a rigorous MILP mathematical model for the VRPTW problem is first introduced. Likewise other optimization approaches, the new formulation can efficiently solve case studies involving at most 25 nodes to optimality. To overcome this limitation, a preprocessing stage clustering nodes together is initially performed to yield a more compact cluster-based MILP problem formulation. In this way, a hierarchical hybrid procedure involving one heuristic and two algorithmic phases was developed. Phase I aims to identifying a set of cost-effective feasible clusters while Phase II assigns clusters to vehicles and sequences them on each tour by using the cluster-based MILP formulation. Ordering nodes within clusters and scheduling vehicle arrival times at customer locations for each tour through solving a small MILP model is finally performed at Phase III. Numerous benchmark problems featuring different sizes, clustered/random customer locations and time window distributions have been solved at acceptable CPU times.},

	abstract = {We present a unified heuristic which is able to solve five different variants of the vehicle routing problem: the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), the site-dependent vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) and the open vehicle routing problem (OVRP).
All problem variants are transformed into a rich pickup and delivery model and solved using the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) framework presented in Ropke and Pisinger [An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Transportation Science, to appear]. The ALNS framework is an extension of the large neighborhood search framework by Shaw [Using constraint programming and local search methods to solve vehicle routing problems. In: CP-98, Fourth international conference on principles and practice of constraint programming, Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1520, 1998. p. 417–31] with an adaptive layer. This layer adaptively chooses among a number of insertion and removal heuristics to intensify and diversify the search. The presented approach has a number of advantages: it provides solutions of very high quality, the algorithm is robust, and to some extent self-calibrating. Moreover, the unified model allows the dispatcher to mix various variants of VRP problems for individual customers or vehicles.
As we believe that the ALNS framework can be applied to a large number of tightly constrained optimization problems, a general description of the framework is given, and it is discussed how the various components can be designed in a particular setting.
The paper is concluded with a computational study, in which the five different variants of the vehicle routing problem are considered on standard benchmark tests from the literature. The outcome of the tests is promising as the algorithm is able to improve 183 best known solutions out of 486 benchmark tests. The heuristic has also shown promising results for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls as demonstrated in Ropke and Pisinger [A unified heuristic for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls.

In cases, for instance, where a logistics company has more than one depot, the VRP is not suitable. To resolve this limitation, this paper focuses on the VRP with multiple depots, or multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). The MDVRP is NP-hard, which means that an efficient algorithm for solving the problem to optimality is unavailable. To deal with the problem efficiently, two hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs) are developed in this paper. The major difference between the HGAs is that the initial solutions are generated randomly in HGA1. The Clarke and Wright saving method and the nearest neighbor heuristic are incorporated into HGA2 for the initialization procedure. A computational study is carried out to compare the algorithms with different problem sizes. It is proved that the performance of HGA2 is superior to that of HGA1 in terms of the total delivery time.},

Since the total traveling time is not always restrictive as a time window constraint, the objective regarded in this paper comprises not only the cost due to the total traveling distance, but also the cost due to the total traveling time. We propose to use a stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) to solve the problem. The role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover rate and mutation rate after ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLGA, a number of benchmark problems are used to examine its search performance. Also, several search methods, branch and bound, standard GA (i.e., without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, and tabu search, are adopted to compare with FLGA in randomly generated data sets. Simulation results show that FLGA outperforms other search methods in all of three various scenarios.},

Using the iterated local search framework, the heuristic combines tabu search with a simple perturbation mechanism to ensure a broad exploration of the search space.

Moreover, we developed a reactive mechanism that dynamically controls the dimension of the SP models when dealing with large size instances. The algorithm was extensively tested on benchmark instances of the following Vechicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants: (i) Capacitated VRP; (ii) Asymmetric VRP; (iii) Open VRP; (iv) VRP with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery; (v) VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery; (vi) Multi-depot VRP; (vii) Multi-depot VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery.

This paper introduces a dynamic programming methodology for efficiently evaluating compound neighborhoods combining sequence-based moves with an optimal choice of vehicle and depot, and an optimal determination of the first customer to be visited in the route, called rotation. The assignment choices, making the richness of the problem, are thus no more addressed in the solution structure, but implicitly determined during each move evaluation. Two meta-heuristics relying on these concepts, an iterated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm, are presented. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of these methods on classic benchmark instances for multi-depot vehicle routing problems with and without fleet mix, as well as the notable contribution of the implicit depot choice and positioning methods to the search performance. New state-of-the-art results are obtained for multi-depot vehicle routing problems (MDVRP), and multi-depot vehicle fleet mix problems (MDVFMP) with unconstrained fleet size. The proposed concepts are fairly general, and widely applicable to many other vehicle routing variants.},

We are given on input a set of identical vehicles (each having a capacity and a maximum duration), a set of depots, and a set of customers with deterministic demands and service times. The problem consists of determining the routes to be performed to fulfill the demand of the customers by satisfying, for each route, the associated capacity and maximum duration constraints. The objective is to minimize the sum of the traveling costs related to the performed routes. The proposed algorithm is based on a heuristic framework previously introduced by the authors for the solution of the Capacitated Location Routing Problem (CLRP). The algorithm applies a hybrid Granular Tabu Search procedure, which considers different neighborhoods and diversification strategies, to improve the initial solution obtained by a hybrid procedure. Computational experiments on benchmark instances from the literature show that the proposed algorithm is able to produce, within short computing time, several best solutions obtained by the previously published methods and new best solutions.},

One of the most common operational constraint addressed in the scientific literature is that the vehicle fleet is capacitated and the total load transported by a vehicle cannot exceed its capacity.This paper provides a review of the most recent developments that had a major impact in the current state-of-the-art of exact algorithms for vehicle routing problems under capacity constraints, with a focus on the basic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and on heterogeneous vehicle routing problems.The most important mathematical formulations for the problem together with various relaxations are reviewed.

Most algorithmic research and software development in this area focus on a limited number of prototype problems. By building enough flexibility in optimization systems, these can be adapted to various practical contexts. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) is one of the most popular problems in combinatorial optimization, and its study has given rise to several exact and heuristic solution techniques of general applicability. The chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the available exact and heuristic algorithms for the VRP, most of which have been adapted to solve other variants.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we suggest a methodology to solve a cooperative transportation planning problem and to assess its performance. The problem is motivated by a real-world scenario found in the German food industry. Several manufacturers with same customers but complementary food products share their vehicle fleets to deliver their customers. After an appropriate decomposition of the entire problem into sub problems, we obtain a set of rich vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with time windows for the delivery of the orders, capacity constraints, maximum operating times for the vehicles, and outsourcing options. Each of the resulting sub problems is solved by a greedy heuristic that takes the distance of the locations of customers and the time window constraints into account. The greedy heuristic is improved by an appropriate Ant Colony System (ACS). The suggested heuristics to solve the problem are assessed within a dynamic and stochastic environment in a rolling horizon setting using discrete event simulation. We describe the used simulation infrastructure. The results of extensive simulation experiments based on randomly generated problem instances and scenarios are provided and discussed. We show that the cooperative setting outperforms the non-cooperative one.},
