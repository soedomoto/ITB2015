In this paper, we quantitatively compare building a distributed storage infrastructure that is self-repairing and resilient to faults using either a replicated system or an erasure-resilient system. We show that systems employing erasure codes have mean time to failures many orders of magnitude higher than replicated systems with similar storage and bandwidth requirements. More importantly, erasure-resilient systems use an order of magnitude less bandwidth and storage to provide similar system durability as replicated systems.},

However, the flooding-based query algorithm used in Gnutella does not scale; each query generates a large amount of traffic and large systems quickly become overwhelmed by the query-induced load. This paper explores, through simulation, various alternatives to Gnutella's query algorithm, data replication strategy, and network topology. We propose a query algorithm based on multiple random walks that resolves queries almost as quickly as Gnutella's flooding method while reducing the network traffic by two orders of magnitude in many cases. We also present simulation results on a distributed replication strategy proposed in [8]. Finally, we find that among the various network topologies we consider, uniform random graphs yield the best performance.},

One of the biggest challenges impeding growth of mobile grid computing is the lack of techniques to effective manage jobs in a mobile grid.

Recent advances in mobile phone computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address the client hardware constraints. Long battery life, wireless connectivity, solid-state memory, low price and immediate utility all make it better suited to rural conditions than a PC. However, current mobile software platforms are not as appropriate. Web-based mobile applications are hard to use, do not take advantage of the mobile phone's media capabilities and require an online connection. Custom mobile applications are difficult to develop and distribute. To address these limitations we present CAM - a new framework for developing and deploying mobile computing applications in the rural developing world. CAM applications are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera, or entering numeric strings with the keypad. Supporting minimal navigation, direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction, CAM is uniquely adapted to rural device, user and infrastructure constraints. To illustrate the breadth of the framework, we list a number of CAM-based applications that we have implemented or are planning. These include processing microfinance loans, facilitating rural supply chains, documenting grassroots innovation and accessing electronic medical histories.},

There is little research dealing with disconnection in synchronous groupware from a user and application perspective; as a result, most current groupware systems do not handle disconnection events well, and several user-level problems occur. To address this limitation, we developed the Disco framework, a model for handling several types of disconnection in synchronous groupware. The framework considers how disconnections are identified, what senders and receivers should do during an absence, and what should be done with accumulated data upon reconnection. We have implemented the framework in three applications that show the feasibility, generality, and functionality of our ideas. Our framework is the first to deal with a full range of disconnection issues for synchronous groupware, and shows how groupware can better support the realities of distributed collaboration.},

	abstract = {Today's communication techniques for mobile ad hoc networks take a connection-oriented approach. Mobile nodes need to discover routes and establish a connection before they can communicate. This strategy is not robust as it cannot adapt to frequent unpredictable topology changes due to high mobility. Constant reconnections incur significant overhead making these schemes unsuitable for applications such as voice and video. To address these issues, we explore a connectionless paradigm in this paper. We leverage technology such as GPS (global positioning system) to allow a source node to discover a grid path to the destination node. Data packets are relayed along this path toward the destination using different intermediate nodes at different times without having to first establish connections between them. The performance of this new solution is essentially unaffected by node mobility. As a result, it is suitable for a wide range of mobile applications.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a substantial increase in commodity computer and network performance, mainly as a result of faster hardware and more sophisticated software. Nevertheless, there are still problems, in the fields of science, engineering, and business, which cannot be effectively dealt with using the current generation of supercomputers. In fact, due to their size and complexity, these problems are often very numerically and/or data intensive and consequently require a variety ofheterogeneous resources that are not available on a single machine. A number of teams have conducted experimental studies on the cooperative use of geographically distributed resources unified to act as a single powerful computer. This new approach is known by several names, such as metacomputing, scalable computing, global computing, Internet computing, and more recently peer-to-peer or Grid computing. The early efforts in Grid computing started as a project to link supercomputing sites, but have now grown far beyond their original intent. In fact, many applications can benefit from the Grid infrastructure, including collaborative engineering, data exploration, high-throughput computing, and of course distributed supercomputing. Moreover, due to the rapid growth of the Internet and Web, there has been a rising interest in Web-based distributed computing, and many projects have been started and aim to exploit the Web as an infrastructure for running coarse-grained distributed and parallel applications. In this context, the Web has the capability to be a platform for parallel and collaborative work as well as a key technology to create a pervasive and ubiquitous Grid-based infrastructure. This paper aims to present the state-of-the-art of Grid computing and attempts to survey the major international efforts in developing this emerging technology.

Due to constraints of the existing infrastructure (power, communications, etc), it is often difficult to deliver these services to remote areas in a timely and efficient manner. The CAM framework has found success as a flexible platform for quickly developing and deploying high-impact applications for these environments. Many of the applications built with CAM have relied on a model where a field worker with a mobile phone regularly returns from a disconnected environment to one with connectivity. In this connected state, the phone and a centralized server can exchange information and get the collected data backed up on reliable media. We propose extending CAM's networking model to enable continual operation in disconnected environments. Using a set of heterogeneous paths made available through social and geographic relationships naturally present among workers, we describe a system for asynchronously routing data in a best-effort manner.},

Most currently available approaches are based on replication strategies. These strategies achieve persistency even in highly dynamic environments, but have to pay a high price in terms of redundancy. Our proposed architecture is based on the adaptation of fault-tolerant data distribution strategies utilizing erasure codes, such as RAID or Reed-Solomon, and thus combines consistency and persistency with high storage efficiency.},

	abstract = {Coverage is one of the fundamental concepts in the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the sense that the monitoring quality of a phenomenon depends on the quality of service provided by the sensors in terms of how well a field of interest is covered. It enables the sensors to detect any event that may occur in the field, thus, meeting the application-specific requirements. Several applications require k-coverage, where each point in the field is covered by at least k sensors, which helps increase data availability to ensure better data reliability. Achieving k-coverage of a field of interest becomes a more challenging issue in sparsely deployed WSNs. Though the problem of coverage in WSNs has been well studied in the literature, only little research efforts have been devoted to the case of sparsely deployed WSNs. Thus, in this article, we investigate the problem of k-coverage in sparse WSNs using static and mobile sensors, which do not necessarily have the same communication range, sensing range, and energy supply. Precisely, we propose an optimized, generalized framework for k-coverage in sparsely deployed WSNs, called k-SCHEMES, which exploits sensor heterogeneity and mobility. First, we characterize k-coverage using heterogeneous sensors based on Helly's Theorem. Second, we introduce our energy-efficient four-tier architecture to achieve mobile k-coverage of a region of interest in a field. Third, on top of this architecture, we suggest two data-gathering protocols, called direct data-gathering and forwarding chain-based data-gathering, using the concept of mobile proxy sink. We found that the second data-gathering protocol outperforms the first one. For energy-efficient forwarding, we compute the minimum transmission distance between any pair of consecutive mobile proxy sinks forming the forwarding chain as well as the corresponding optimum number of mobile proxy sinks in this chain. We corroborate our analysis with several simulation results.},

	doi = {10.1109/TENCONSpring.2014.6863002},
	abstract = {Split-connection type proxies have been proposed to improve TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) throughput in network environment with wireless LANs. A proxy is placed at the boundary of a wireless LAN (WLAN) and a wired network and it splits a TCP connection into two virtual TCP connections. We proposed a split-connection type proxy called MDA-Proxy (Modified Decreasing-ACK Proxy), which increases throughput of upflows (flows from wireless hosts to wired hosts) by decreasing the number of ACKs in a WLAN. MDA-Proxy uses two parameters, ack\_stock and delay\_timer, for each connection. The former controls the number of ACKs sent to a WLAN and the latter is used to recover from losses and delays of ACKs in a wired network. However, it is assumed that MDA-Proxy uses fixed values of the two parameters and their automatic tuning in response to network situation remains to be future work. In this paper, we propose a new type of proxy called ASA-Proxy (Ack\_Stock Autotunning Proxy), which automatically tunes the two parameters in MDA-Proxy. Ack\_stock is tuned comparing throughputs before and after its changing so that throughput of the connection becomes large, and delay\_timer is replaced by the normal TCP retransmission timer because it is better than a fixed value of delay\_timer for the inference of losses and delays of ACKs in a wired network. Extensive simulation runs show that ASA-Proxy is superior to MDA-Proxy.},

	doi = {10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354565},
	abstract = {Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming media by partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing the byte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metric delayed startup ratio). However, these efforts do not guarantee continuous media delivery because the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they are demanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delay in fetching the uncached segments, which we call proxy jitter. Thus, for the best interests of clients, a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jitter subject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio. However, we have observed two major pairs of conflicting interests inherent in this model: (1) one between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing proxy jitter, and (2) the other between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing the delayed startup ratio. In this study, we first propose an active prefetching method for in-time prefetching of uncached segments, which provides insights into the first pair of conflicting interests. Second, we further improve our lazy-segmentation scheme which effectively addresses the second pair of the conflicting interests. Finally, considering our main objective of minimizing proxy jitter and optimizing the two trade-offs, we propose a new streaming proxy system called Hyper Proxy by effectively coordinating both prefetching and segmentation techniques. Synthetic and real workloads are used to systematically evaluate our system. The performance results show that the hyper proxy system generates minimum proxy jitter with a low delayed startup ratio and a small decrease of byte hit ratio compared with existing schemes},

	abstract = {As Internet traffic continues to grow and web sites become increasingly complex, performance and scalability are major issues for web sites. Web sites are increasingly relying on dynamic content generation applications to provide web site visitors with dynamic, interactive, and personalized experiences. However, dynamic content generation comes at a cost --- each request requires computation as well as communication across multiple components.To address these issues, various dynamic content caching approaches have been proposed. Proxy-based caching approaches store content at various locations outside the site infrastructure and can improve Web site performance by reducing content generation delays, firewall processing delays, and bandwidth requirements. However, existing proxy-based caching approaches either (a) cache at the page level, which does not guarantee that correct pages are served and provides very limited reusability, or (b) cache at the fragment level, which requires the use of pre-defined page layouts. To address these issues, several back end caching approaches have been proposed, including query result caching and fragment level caching. While back end approaches guarantee the correctness of results and offer the advantages of fine-grained caching, they neither address firewall delays nor reduce bandwidth requirements.In this paper, we present an approach and an implementation of a dynamic proxy caching technique which combines the benefits of both proxy-based and back end caching approaches, yet does not suffer from their above-mentioned limitations. Our dynamic proxy caching technique allows granular, proxy-based caching where both the content and layout can be dynamic. Our analysis of the performance of our approach indicates that it is capable of providing significant reductions in bandwidth. We have also deployed our proposed dynamic proxy caching technique at a major financial institution. The results of this implementation indicate that our technique is capable of providing order-of-magnitude reductions in bandwidth and response times in real-world dynamic Web applications.},

In a distributed system, the structure of a service or subsystem may be complex, being implemented as a set of communicating server objects; however, this complexity of structure should not be apparent to the client. In our proposal, a client must rst acquire a local object, called a proxy, in order to use such a service. The proxy represents the whole set of servers. The client directs all its communication to the proxy. The proxy, and all the objects it represents, collectively form one distributed object, which is not decomposable by the client. Any higher-level communication protocols are internal to this distributed object. Such a view provides a powerful structuring framework for distributed systems; it can be implemented cheaply without sacricing much exibility. It subsumes may previous proposals, but encourages better information-hiding and encapsulation},

	abstract = {With the development of modern network technology, the distributed construction is considered to represent the trend of SOA. Since it is more likely to be a theoretic framework for a macroscopic system rather than practical software architecture to implement it, the urgent problem is that there is no standard development pattern for implementation of SOA. On the other hand, OSGi, which is integrated with service as the smallest unit, shares common goal with SOA, may make contributions to the implementation of SOA by providing practical software architecture. However OSGi has the shortage that the operation is limited in one JVM and communications of OSGi services can not be extended to different hosts. OSGi should be extended to distributed architecture in order to support distributed SOA implementation. Attempts are made in this article to design an extended distributed OSGi architecture for the purpose of developing a practical development pattern for SOA implementation. In this article, three new independent OSGi services are designed to implement distribution without modifying the existed OSGi code. They are basic service, registry service and proxy service. In the new distributed OSGi runtime environment, services in different JVM could call each other and the whole processes are transparent.},

	abstract = {Describes the design and operation of a composable proxy infrastructure that enables mobile Internet users to collaborate via heterogeneous devices and network connections. The approach is based on detachable Java I/O streams, which enable proxy filters and transcoders to be dynamically inserted, removed, and reordered on a given data stream. Unlike conventional Java I/O streams, detachable streams can be stopped, disconnected, reconnected, and restarted. As such, they provide a convenient method by which to support the dynamic composition of proxy services. Moreover, use of the I/O stream abstraction enables network distribution and stream adaptability to be implemented transparently with respect to application components. The operation and implementation of detachable streams are described. To evaluate the composable proxy infrastructure, it is used to enhance interactive audio communication among users of a Web-based collaborative computing framework. Two forward error correction (FEC) proxylets are developed, one using block erasure codes and the other using the GSM 06.10 encoding algorithm. Separately, each type of FEC improves the ability of the audio stream to tolerate errors in a wireless LAN environment. When composed in a single proxy, however, they cooperate to correct additional types of burst errors. Results are presented from a performance study conducted on a mobile computing testbed.},

	abstract = {The problem of disconnection from network is one that mobile users always have to face in mobile computing environment. Disconnected operation is one approach to ease this problem by allowing client computers to work solely on cached files in the local disks. However, a cache miss in disconnected operation is often critical, and usually causes the user to stop work on the current task until reconnecting to the server. To avoid such situations, we propose an approach called cache cooperation, which resolves cache misses in a coordinated manner among the clients. Cache cooperation allows each client to retrieve the missing data from the other remote clients when the client is disconnected from the server but not isolated from others. We describe the design of our prototype implementation, its performance measurement, and the results of vast numbers of simulations that we conducted with system-call traces recorded over 3-month period. The measured performance shows that the overhead of our approach is almost comparable to that of the normal client-server file operations. Moreover, the simulation results confirm that our approach can effectively decrease cache misses when multiple client caches can be utilized. Especially, in ideal cases where major files are shared by multiple clients, our approach saves almost all of cache misses for over 70 percent of simulation runs.},

Furthermore, the automation of the majority of the required code transformation has been implemented, which along with the deployment of various (proxy-based) adaptive and test applications, demonstrates the transparency, correctness, flexibility, and practicality of the solution. As the solution was presented in terms of Java, the discussion involves Java-specific characteristics; however some of the more general concepts should be useful for addressing similar issues in other object-oriented languages.},

	abstract = {A \textit{proxy} object is a surrogate or placeholder that controls access to another target object. Proxies can be used to support distributed programming, lazy or parallel evaluation, access control, and other simple forms of behavioral reflection. However, \textit{wrapper proxies} (like \textit{futures} or \textit{suspensions} for yet-to-be-computed results) can require significant code changes to be used in statically-typed languages, while proxies more generally can inadvertently violate assumptions of transparency, resulting in subtle bugs. To solve these problems, we have designed and implemented a simple framework for proxy programming that employs a static analysis based on qualifier inference, but with additional novelties. Code for using wrapper proxies is automatically introduced via a classfile-to-classfile transformation, and potential violations of transparency are signaled to the programmer. We have formalized our analysis and proven it sound. Our framework has a variety of applications, including support for asynchronous method calls returning futures. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our framework: programmers are relieved of managing and/or checking proxy usage, analysis times are reasonably fast, overheads introduced by added dynamic checks are negligible, and performance improvements can be significant. For example, changing two lines in a simple RMI-based peer-to-peer application and then using our framework resulted in a large performance gain.},

Here "legacy" means the software originally developed to be executed on a single Java virtual machine (JVM). For adapting legacy software to distributed execution on multiple JVM, developers using Addistant have only to specify the host where instances of each class are allocated and how remote references are implemented. According to that specification, Addistant automatically transforms the bytecode at load time. A technical contribution by Addistant is that it covers a number of issues for implementing distributed execution in the real world. In fact, Addistant can adapt a legacy program written with the Swing library so that Swing objects are executed on a local JVM while the rest of objects are on a remote JVM.},

J-Orchestra takes as input Java applications in bytecode format and transforms them into distributed applications, running on distinct Java Virtual Machines. To accomplish such automatic partitioning, J-Orchestra uses bytecode rewriting to substitute method calls with remote method calls, direct object references with proxy references, etc. Using J-Orchestra does not require great sophistication in distributed system methodology--the user only has to specify the network location of various hardware and software resources and their corresponding application classes. J-Orchestra has significant generality, flexibility, and degree of automation advantages compared to previous work on automatic partitioning. For instance, J-Orchestra can correctly partition almost any pure Java program, allowing any application object to be placed on any machine, regardless of how application objects access each other and Java system objects. This power is due to the novel way that J-Orchestra deals with unmodifiable code (e.g., native code in the Java system classes). Additionally, J-Orchestra offers support for object migration and run-time optimizations, like the lazy creation of distributed objects.We have used J-Orchestra to successfully partition several realistic applications including a command line shell, a ray tracer, and several applications with native dependencies (sound, graphics).},

	abstract = {Information flows all around us all the time. Whether on computer networks, on telephone lines, or within the wiring of everyday devices such as coffeemakers or gas pumps, data are constantly being transmitted from one place to another. Much of the time, such data flow directly between information producers and information consumers. Sometimes, however, intermediary processes stand in the way of a simple data flow, for instance, to monitor traffic, to bridge between incompatible communication streams, or to customize or extend the functions that are natively available on a stream. Intermediaries can turn ordinary information streams into smart streams that enhance the quality of communication. Because information flows are now everywhere, there is a new opportunity for taking advantage of intermediary computation, but general principles and approaches have not yet been developed. This paper provides an introduction to the intermediary approach, describes an implemented Web intermediary framework and applications, and proposes extending intermediaries to other information streams.},

	abstract = {This article summarizes the results of the BARWAN project, which focused on enabling truly useful mobile networking across an extremely wide variety of real-world networks and mobile devices. We present the overall architecture, summarize key results, and discuss four broad lessons learned along the way. The architecture enables seamless roaming in a single logical overlay network composed of many heterogeneous (mostly wireless) physical networks, and provides significantly better TCP performance for these networks. It also provides complex scalable and highly available services to enable powerful capabilities across a very wide range of mobile devices, and mechanisms for automated discovery and configuration of localized services. Four broad themes arose from the project: (1) the power of dynamic adaptation as a generic solution to heterogeneity, (2) the importance of cross-layer information, such as the exploitation of TCP semantics in the link layer, (3) the use of agents in the infrastructure to enable new abilities and to hide new problems from legacy servers and protocol stacks, and (4) the importance of soft state for such agents for simplicity, ease of fault recovery, and scalability},

The paper describes an approach to failure recovery for three-tier client and server application environments where the client applications execute on wireless handheld devices. The key idea is to have the middle-tier proxy transparently monitor the client's interaction with the back-end server and continuously maintain a copy of the client's state based on messages exchanged between the client and the server. The proxy also sustains the client's connection to the back-end server when a client unexpectedly disconnects. The client does not participate in checkpointing nor message logging, thereby saving power, processor cycles and bandwidth. The proxy is scalable and enhances backend server performance. Experimental results are provided for recovery time and runtime overhead},

	abstract = {Billions of dollars of electricity are being used to keep idle or unused network hosts fully powered-on only to maintain their network presence. We investigate how a network connectivity proxy (NCP) could enable significant energy savings by allowing idle hosts to enter a low-power sleep state and still maintain full network presence. An NCP must handle ARP, ICMP, DHCP, and other low-level network presence tasks for a network host. An NCP must also be able to maintain TCP connections and UDP data flows and to respond to application messages. The focus of this paper is on how TCP connections can be kept alive during periods of host sleep by using a SOCKS-based approach called green SOCKS (gSOCKS) as part of an NCP. The gSOCKS includes awareness of the power state of a host. A prototype implementation of gSOCKS in a Linksys router shows that TCP connections can be preserved.},

	title = {Smart proxying for reducing network energy consumption},
	abstract = {Many network-based applications require full time connectivity of the hosts for fate sharing and responding to routine applications/protocols heart-beat messages. Past studies revealed that network hosts are most of the time unused or idle but still kept powered on just to maintain network connectivity. Thus, significant energy savings are possible if the network hosts can sleep when idle. Unfortunately, present low-power sleep modes cannot maintain network connectivity and results in applications state loss, thus preventing users from enabling power management features. A proxy-based solution was recently proposed in the literature that allows network hosts to sleep and still maintain their network standings over Internet while requiring minor changes to applications/protocols. The Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) can handle some basic network presence and management protocols like ICMP, DHCP, ARP etc on behalf of sleeping hosts and wake them up only when it is truly necessary. This paper addresses NCP generic architecture and its requirements, main NCP responsibilities, different NCP types and their characteristics and some possible solutions to preserve open TCP connections for the sleeping hosts. It also describes key challenges in the design and implementation of NCP and proposes possible solutions. NCP can result in significant network energy savings up to 70\% depending on the hosts time usage model.},

	abstract = {Opportunistic networks are one of the most interesting evolutions of MANETs. In opportunistic networks, mobile nodes are enabled to communicate with each other even if a route connecting them never exists. Furthermore, nodes are not supposed to possess or acquire any knowledge about the network topology, which (instead) is necessary in traditional MANET routing protocols. Routes are built dynamically, while messages are en route between the sender and the destination(s), and any possible node can opportunistically be used as next hop, provided it is likely to bring the message closer to the final destination. These requirements make opportunistic networks a challenging and promising research field. In this article we survey the most interesting case studies related to opportunistic networking and discuss and organize a taxonomy for the main routing and forwarding approaches in this challenging environment. We finally envision further possible scenarios to make opportunistic networks part of the next-generation Internet},

	abstract = {Routing protocols in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) are designed to provide data delivery in frequently changing network topology. Existing MANET routing protocols set up an end-to-end path between source and destination prior to data forwarding. Maintaining a connected path before data delivery may not work well when the network is partially disconnected or disrupted. This paper discusses Opportunistic Multi-link Delay Tolerant Routing (OMDTR) which is designed to provide data delivery in the network where fully connected network topology is not guaranteed. OMDTR learns the local network connectivity and deliver the data if there is connectivity within two-hop. OMDTR exploits the robustness of flooding-based routing when there is no local network connectivity. Performance measurements of OMDTR protocol show that OMDTR increases the data delivery compared to pure flooding-based routing and pure end-to-end routing in mobile multi-hop wireless network with relatively high and low network density.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers hâve pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},
