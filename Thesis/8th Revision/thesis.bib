	abstract = {Existing Web services standards consider data primarily on the level of inputs and outputs specifications, with the major focus on functional aspects of interactions. Majority of applications rely on data sources, but such data sources are not part of the Web service specifications and cannot be accessed directly by clients. The fact that data are treated independently or as second-class citizens severely limits re-use, flexibility, customization and integration options of current Web services. In this paper we suggest to extend the WS specifications by introducing a data-centric Web services model that integrates functional and data perspectives in one coherent framework. The approach is based on Business Artifacts and in particular on the declarative modular Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) model. We introduce a Web Data- and Artifact- centric Service (W-DAS) model using GSM in its core which in addition to usual application specific WS operations defines a set of data access interfaces including CRUD operations, artifacts retrieval interface for querying, filtering and sorting data, and operations for arbitrary custom defined ad hoc run-time queries. We discuss W-DAS publish-subscribe mechanisms and implementation.},

We show that systems employing erasure codes have mean time to failures many orders of magnitude higher than replicated systems with similar storage and bandwidth requirements. More importantly, erasure-resilient systems use an order of magnitude less bandwidth and storage to provide similar system durability as replicated systems.},

We define synchronization, replication, and routing mechanism to support distributed systems. This paper introduces the design as preliminary result of our research.

	abstract = {Parallel database systems horizontally partition large amounts of structured data in order to provide parallel data processing capabilities for analytical workloads in shared-nothing clusters. One major challenge when horizontally partitioning large amounts of data is to reduce the network costs for a given workload and a database schema. A common technique to reduce the network costs in parallel database systems is to co-partition tables on their join key in order to avoid expensive remote join operations. However, existing partitioning schemes are limited in that respect since only subsets of tables in complex schemata sharing the same join key can be co-partitioned unless tables are fully replicated. In this paper we present a novel partitioning scheme called predicate-based reference partition (or PREF for short) that allows to co-partition sets of tables based on given join predicates. Moreover, based on PREF, we present two automatic partitioning design algorithms to maximize data-locality. One algorithm only needs the schema and data whereas the other algorithm additionally takes the workload as input. In our experiments we show that our automated design algorithms can partition database schemata of different complexity and thus help to effectively reduce the runtime of queries under a given workload when compared to existing partitioning approaches.},

	abstract = {Distributed query processing has become essential in today's scenario to address the changing business needs of users. It aims to arrive at an optimal query processing plan for a given distributed query. This is a complex process as the number of possible query processing plans grows rapidly with increase in the number of sites used, and relations accessed, by the query. Therefore, there is a need to determine optimal query processing plans among all possible plans. The approach presented in this paper attempts to generate such optimal query processing plans using genetic algorithm. As per the approach, the query plans having the required data residing close to each other are considered more efficient and, therefore, are generated. These generated query plans would result in efficient query processing. Further, experimental results show that the approach is able to generate such optimal query processing plans in a fewer number of generations.},

Keyed data events are routed with affinity to Processing Elements (PEs), which consume the events and do one or both of the following: (1) emit one or more events which may be consumed by other PEs, (2) publish results. The architecture resembles the Actors model, providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this paper, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our design is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.},

	abstract = {Cluster and grid computing are becoming very popular, particularly for scientific and engineering applications. Higher bandwidth of computer networks has further boosted development of cluster computing. Local and geographically dispersed deployment of computing resources is the most prominent differentiating issue between a cluster and grid computing based setups. Cluster necessarily requires deployment of multiple nodes at a single location connected via a high speed switch, while grid computing is based on access to remote computing resources, which may be a cluster. Integrating software with multi-layer integration has been the main thrust of research and development in the field of cluster and grid computing. In this paper a novel idea of building a virtual grid over a local area network, deploying resources by pooling has been suggested. The system uses one monitoring server to keep track of various parameters pertaining to the pooled resources and tasks deployed on the system. Software module for integrating the pooled resource has been developed and a prototype model of virtual computing grid using resource pooling (VCGuRP) has been deployed. The paper describes various design and implementation details of the system and also discusses performance issues and their evaluation.},

However, the flooding-based query algorithm used in Gnutella does not scale; each query generates a large amount of traffic and large systems quickly become overwhelmed by the query-induced load. This paper explores, through simulation, various alternatives to Gnutella's query algorithm, data replication strategy, and network topology. We propose a query algorithm based on multiple random walks that resolves queries almost as quickly as Gnutella's flooding method while reducing the network traffic by two orders of magnitude in many cases. We also present simulation results on a distributed replication strategy proposed in [8]. Finally, we find that among the various network topologies we consider, uniform random graphs yield the best performance.},

	abstract = {In the context of Internet of Things (IoT), data acquisition, management, and analysis for knowledge extraction has given rise to a new generation of services. The heterogeneity of services being offered today on the enormous expanse of data as available from sensors and smart devices, needs a distributed infrastructure for analysis and computation. We consider a scenario where the computing infrastructure of an IoT framework is distributed and is capable of harnessing the computing power of mobile devices connected to the network in a heterogeneous grid. Edge devices like smart-phones, gateways, etc. can potentially contribute to the infrastructure. However, such devices and communication channels to such devices are intermittently unavailable, which may be due to network failure, planned shut-down, high workload on the devices, etc. In addition to this, we consider a task offloading context where the computing infrastructure inside the IoT invites bids from connected and available devices from the network to offload a part of the computation on part of the input data-set. We expect the overall completion time to improve in this setting. We investigate the data partitioning problem under the scenario where unavailability of communication and computation are advertised a priori and we pose the problem as a scheduling problem where cost of execution of an analysis job is to be minimized. We present a constraint-based model, evaluate the same on various scenarios and present some of the results.},

	doi = {10.1109/BigData.2015.7364063},
	abstract = {According to current market trends, there is a huge demand to process large volume, velocity and variety of data. Real time and static data processing needs to be compliant to big data standards to provide a promising future. For data processing based business solutions, at each intermediate stage of processing, data correctness is important. However in real life scenario various sources of data corruption can be encountered. In this paper we are targeting on solution that can handle data corruption, ensures fault tolerance to a maximum extent and provides synchronization among processing entities in distributed environment. Here we have prototyped our proposal on top of an open source framework Trident, a big data technology to process real time data. The proposal can be efficiently used for cascaded data processing use cases (output of one processing chain is input to another processing chain). Common use cases adhering to data correctness are data interpolation, statistics management, billing software, data fraud analysis etc. Current paper describes an architecture which enhances the data processing capability of current Trident implementation in distributed environment for cascaded or interdependent data processing use cases. Our solution drives life cycle initiation in a transactional manner for the processing flow based on the status of individual processing nodes. This approach provides global chain level initialization and avoids data loss or data duplication due to external entities. Here we have focused on corruption due to initialization latency which can occur due to external entity connection discrepancy/external protocol response dependency/ third party software initialization dependency. The proposed solution can prove useful to handle both real time and static data for providing synchronization, fault tolerance and reliability.},

Recent advances in mobile phone computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address the client hardware constraints. Long battery life, wireless connectivity, solid-state memory, low price and immediate utility all make it better suited to rural conditions than a PC. However, current mobile software platforms are not as appropriate. Web-based mobile applications are hard to use, do not take advantage of the mobile phone's media capabilities and require an online connection. Custom mobile applications are difficult to develop and distribute. To address these limitations we present CAM - a new framework for developing and deploying mobile computing applications in the rural developing world. CAM applications are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera, or entering numeric strings with the keypad. Supporting minimal navigation, direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction, CAM is uniquely adapted to rural device, user and infrastructure constraints. To illustrate the breadth of the framework, we list a number of CAM-based applications that we have implemented or are planning. These include processing microfinance loans, facilitating rural supply chains, documenting grassroots innovation and accessing electronic medical histories.},

This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its implementation. The case study of a continuous anomaly detector in use at Google serves to motivate how many of MillWheel's features are used. MillWheel's programming model provides a notion of logical time, making it simple to write time-based aggregations. MillWheel was designed from the outset with fault tolerance and scalability in mind.

There is little research dealing with disconnection in synchronous groupware from a user and application perspective; as a result, most current groupware systems do not handle disconnection events well, and several user-level problems occur. To address this limitation, we developed the Disco framework, a model for handling several types of disconnection in synchronous groupware. The framework considers how disconnections are identified, what senders and receivers should do during an absence, and what should be done with accumulated data upon reconnection. We have implemented the framework in three applications that show the feasibility, generality, and functionality of our ideas. Our framework is the first to deal with a full range of disconnection issues for synchronous groupware, and shows how groupware can better support the realities of distributed collaboration.},

	abstract = {Today's communication techniques for mobile ad hoc networks take a connection-oriented approach. Mobile nodes need to discover routes and establish a connection before they can communicate. This strategy is not robust as it cannot adapt to frequent unpredictable topology changes due to high mobility. Constant reconnections incur significant overhead making these schemes unsuitable for applications such as voice and video. To address these issues, we explore a connectionless paradigm in this paper. We leverage technology such as GPS (global positioning system) to allow a source node to discover a grid path to the destination node. Data packets are relayed along this path toward the destination using different intermediate nodes at different times without having to first establish connections between them. The performance of this new solution is essentially unaffected by node mobility. As a result, it is suitable for a wide range of mobile applications.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a substantial increase in commodity computer and network performance, mainly as a result of faster hardware and more sophisticated software. Nevertheless, there are still problems, in the fields of science, engineering, and business, which cannot be effectively dealt with using the current generation of supercomputers. In fact, due to their size and complexity, these problems are often very numerically and/or data intensive and consequently require a variety ofheterogeneous resources that are not available on a single machine. A number of teams have conducted experimental studies on the cooperative use of geographically distributed resources unified to act as a single powerful computer. This new approach is known by several names, such as metacomputing, scalable computing, global computing, Internet computing, and more recently peer-to-peer or Grid computing. The early efforts in Grid computing started as a project to link supercomputing sites, but have now grown far beyond their original intent. In fact, many applications can benefit from the Grid infrastructure, including collaborative engineering, data exploration, high-throughput computing, and of course distributed supercomputing. Moreover, due to the rapid growth of the Internet and Web, there has been a rising interest in Web-based distributed computing, and many projects have been started and aim to exploit the Web as an infrastructure for running coarse-grained distributed and parallel applications. In this context, the Web has the capability to be a platform for parallel and collaborative work as well as a key technology to create a pervasive and ubiquitous Grid-based infrastructure. This paper aims to present the state-of-the-art of Grid computing and attempts to survey the major international efforts in developing this emerging technology.

Most of the existing approaches to this problem are designed for the centralized setting where query processing takes place on a single server; it is difficult, if not impossible, for them to scale to a distributed setting to handle the vast volume of data and concurrent queries that are increasingly common in those applications. To address this problem, we propose a suite of solutions that can support scalable distributed processing of k-NN queries. We first present a new index structure called Dynamic Strip Index (DSI), which can better adapt to different data distributions than exiting grid indexes. Moreover, it can be naturally distributed across the cluster, therefore lending itself well to distributed processing. We further propose a distributed k-NN search (DKNN) algorithm based on DSI. DKNN avoids having an uncertain number of potentially expensive iterations, and is thus more efficient and more predictable than existing approaches. DSI and DKNN are implemented on Apache S4, an open-source platform for distributed stream processing. We perform extensive experiments to study the characteristics of DSI and DKNN, and compare them with three baseline methods. Experimental results show that our proposal scales well and significantly outperforms the alternative methods.},

However, with proliferation of smartphones, low cost mobile connectivity with good coverage and availability of several data collection applications that can even work around the connectivity concerns, pen-paper surveys are now being replaced by mobile based data collection. In this work, we discuss the enhancement of Open Data Kit (ODK), an existing mobile based data collection application, with features such as pre-filling and validation SMS. The additional features were motivated from the real world requirements of reducing the data collection effort and minimizing the discrepancies in records for a project requiring information dissemination to beneficiaries of National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), a government of India scheme. Data collection exercise, using our extended tool, is currently ongoing in two districts across two different states in India. Preliminary results from one deployment indicate that even with 8\% of pre-filled fields in a form, there was a 16.1\% decrease in the errors. Additionally, time per survey reduced with the pre-filling option. Preliminary results from another deployment indicate that 35\% of the pre-filled forms had mismatched or changed information when compared with the data available in government records.},

Due to constraints of the existing infrastructure (power, communications, etc), it is often difficult to deliver these services to remote areas in a timely and efficient manner. The CAM framework has found success as a flexible platform for quickly developing and deploying high-impact applications for these environments. Many of the applications built with CAM have relied on a model where a field worker with a mobile phone regularly returns from a disconnected environment to one with connectivity. In this connected state, the phone and a centralized server can exchange information and get the collected data backed up on reliable media. We propose extending CAM's networking model to enable continual operation in disconnected environments. Using a set of heterogeneous paths made available through social and geographic relationships naturally present among workers, we describe a system for asynchronously routing data in a best-effort manner.},

	abstract = {Unbounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile usage statistics, and sensor networks). At the same time, consumers of these datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering and windowing by features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly competing propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems. We propose that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal with these evolved requirements in modern data processing. We as a field must stop trying to groom unbounded datasets into finite pools of information that eventually become complete, and instead live and breathe under the assumption that we will never know if or when we have seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data may be retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via principled abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of appropriate tradeoffs along the axes of interest: correctness, latency, and cost. In this paper, we present one such approach, the Dataflow Model, along with a detailed examination of the semantics it enables, an overview of the core principles that guided its design, and a validation of the model itself via the real-world experiences that led to its development.},

One open issue is how to effectively partition a large graph to process complex graph operations efficiently. In this paper, we present VB-Partitioner -- a distributed data partitioning model and algorithms for efficient processing of graph operations over large-scale graphs in the Cloud. Our VB-Partitioner has three salient features. First, it introduces vertex blocks (VBs) and extended vertex blocks (EVBs) as the building blocks for semantic partitioning of large graphs. Second, VB-Partitioner utilizes vertex block grouping algorithms to place those vertex blocks that have high correlation in graph structure into the same partition. Third, VB-Partitioner employs a VB-partition guided query partitioning model to speed up the parallel processing of graph pattern queries by reducing the amount of inter-partition query processing. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world graphs with millions of vertices and billions of edges. Our results show that VB-Partitioner significantly outperforms the popular random block-based data partitioner in terms of query latency and scalability over large-scale graphs.},

To solve synthesis problems of distributed service-oriented structures an algorithm of conformal mapping topology that is based on the definition of hyperbolic virtual coordinates has been proposed. This algorithm requires less iterations than other methods and is able to provide guaranteed delivery of data and decreasing of ratio between the number of iterations and nodes in the process of intensive rapid convergence.},

	abstract = {The Grid is an emerging infrastructure that will fundamentally change the way we think about-and use-computing. The word Grid is used by analogy with the electric power grid, which provides pervasive access to electricity and has had a dramatic impact on human capabilities and society. Many believe that by allowing all components of our information technology infrastructure-computational capabilities, databases, sensors, and people-to be shared flexibly as true collaborative tools the Grid will have a similar transforming effect, allowing new classes of applications to emerge. -From the Preface In 1998, Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman introduced a whole new concept in computing with the first edition of this book. Today there is a broader and deeper understanding of the nature of the opportunities offered by Grid computing and the technologies needed to realize those opportunities. In Grid 2, the editors reveal the revolutionary impact of large-scale resource sharing and virtualization within science and industry, the intimate relationships between organization and resource sharing structures and the new technologies required to enable secure, reliable, and efficient resource sharing on large scale.Foster and Kesselman have once again assembled a team of experts to present an up-to-date view of Grids that reports on real experiences and explains the available technologies and new technologies emerging from labs, companies and standards bodies. Grid 2, like its predecessor, serves as a manifesto, design blueprint, user guide and research agenda for future Grid systems.*30 chapters including more than a dozen completely new chapters.*Web access to 13 unchanged chapters from the first edition.*Three personal essays by influential thinkers on the significance of Grids from the perspectives of infrastructure, industry, and science.*A foundational overview of the central Grid concepts and architectural principles.*Twelve application vignettes showcase working Grids in science, engineering, industry, and commerce.*Detailed discussions of core architecture and services, data and knowledge management, and higher-level tools.*Focused presentations on production Grid deployment, computing platforms, peer-to-peer technologies, and network infrastructures.*Extensive bibliography and glossary.},

	abstract = {Traditional nearest-neighbor (NN) search is based on two basic indexing approaches: object-based indexing and solution-based indexing. The former is constructed based on the locations of data objects: using some distance heuristics on object locations. The latter is built on a precomputed solution space. Thus, NN queries can be reduced to and processed as simple point queries in this solution space. Both approaches exhibit some disadvantages, especially when employed for wireless data broadcast in mobile computing environments.In this paper, we introduce a new index method, called the grid-partition index, to support NN search in both on-demand access and periodic broadcast modes of mobile computing. The grid-partition index is constructed based on the Voronoi diagram, i.e., the solution space of NN queries. However, it has two distinctive characteristics. First, it divides the solution space into grid cells such that a query point can be efficiently mapped into a grid cell around which the nearest object is located. This significantly reduces the search space. Second, the grid-partition index stores the objects that are potential NNs of any query falling within the cell. The storage of objects, instead of the Voronoi cells, makes the grid-partition index a hybrid of the solution-based and object-based approaches. As a result, it achieves a much more compact representation than the pure solution-based approach and avoids backtracked traversals required in the typical object-based approach, thus realizing the advantages of both approaches.We develop an incremental construction algorithm to address the issue of object update. In addition, we present a cost model to approximate the search cost of different grid partitioning schemes. The performances of the grid-partition index and existing indexes are evaluated using both synthetic and real data. The results show that, overall, the grid-partition index significantly outperforms object-based indexes and solution-based indexes. Furthermore, we extend the grid-partition index to support continuous-nearest-neighbor search. Both algorithms and experimental results are presented.},
